# Octal-Impute
The repository consists of all the scripts, data and source code for fast genotype imputation performed on GWAS and GTEX data. We perform private genotype imputation on tag SNPs with genomic distance of 10k and 1k. The weights, biases, scripts performing computation on these two different datasets are appended with '1k' or '10k' respectively.

There are two folders:  
1. Train-test split consists of GWAS data split into training and test data (80-20 split).
